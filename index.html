  TSM, the premier championship e-sports organization, is extremely excited to announce that the LCS roster will be seeing some big changes heading into next split. This split, we saw millions of players rise up and persevere through times of hardship and distress. WHen we couldn't pick 5, we thought why not pick 10? At least with a 10 man roster we will still have half our players if another 5 man sleep happens right???

    Please join us in welcoming these talented individuals, the hope of North America, to the TSM family!
